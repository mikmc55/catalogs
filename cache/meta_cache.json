Led by the hardliner General Botha, a mammoth manhunt ensues in the very mountain where Kepe was rumored to occupy a Noah's Ark like cave. This spectacle ingratiated Kepe in the hearts of the marginalized indigenous-population, who turn Kepe's miscreant deeds into the stuff of legend, making him a threat to the very fabric of the colonial society. Sew the Winter to my Skin is a thrilling, operatic ride into the heart of Pre-Apartheid South Africa and is a visceral exploration of the effects of the colonial displacement that sewed the seeds for one of the most viciously racist, political regimes in history.","popularity":2.071,"poster_path":"/AnC5kFnayIYPRlJa5TRyRG0pHqZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109443,"logo_path":"/imEQZ3Cy1AeLZNDqvoDJRcB1zLf.png","name":"Yellowbone Entertainment","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Man's Bandit is Another Man's Champion","title":"Sew the Winter to My Skin","video":false,"vote_average":7.25,"vote_count":4}},"543988":{"timestamp":1725265167257,"data":{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/s5hz3C6YaXgfGe4UWVCpLRLaxpp.jpg","belongs_to_collection":null,"budget":0,"genres":[{"id":35,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":9648,"name":"Mystery"},{"id":14,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":27,"name":"Horror"}],"homepage":"","id":543988,"imdb_id":"tt6748030","origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_title":"Lake Michigan Monster","overview":"An eccentric sea captain assembles a motley ship crew in a revenge mission to slay the sea monster lurking in Lake Michigan that killed his father.","popularity":3.794,"poster_path":"/cI0MP7G7WiUYxgI7NSW5IILujGm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"BANNED IN FOUR LAKES!\"","title":"Lake Michigan Monster","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":20}},"545572":{"timestamp":1725265168122,"data":{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/vk6o2867HscEDzd1wdlro5YZ7ya.jpg","belongs_to_collection":null,"budget":0,"genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":28,"name":"Action"},{"id":80,"name":"Crime"}],"homepage":"","id":545572,"imdb_id":"tt8254080","origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_title":"The Prey","overview":"An innocent man sentenced to rot in a Cambodian jail is released for the sadistic pleasure of twisted trophy hunters and forced to fight -
